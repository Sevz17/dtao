# dtao - dzen for Wayland

(zen + way -> tao)

This is (will be) a stdin-based general-purpose bar for Wayland, modeled after the venerable [dzen2](https://github.com/robm/dzen).  At the moment, it does little more than display a static string on a layer-shell, but that does mean all the tricky Wayland stuff is out of the way and it's ready for contributions.
